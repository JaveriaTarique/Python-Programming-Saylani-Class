    "Question 1: Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm in which real-world objects are each viewed as separate entities having their own state which is modified only by built in procedures called methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- Modular approach or segmented code aids in troubleshooting\n",
    "- Reuse of code through inheritance\n",
    "- Flexibility through polymorphism\n",
    "- Effective problem solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: Differentiate between function and method?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Functions are defined outside of classes, while Methods are defined inside of and part of classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4: Define the following terms: \n",
    "Class:\n",
    "It is a template or blueprint about the capability of what an object can do.\n",
    "Object:\n",
    "An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.\n",
    "Attribute:\n",
    "Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. In short, attributes store information about the instance.\n",
    "Behavior:\n",
    "Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them.\n",
